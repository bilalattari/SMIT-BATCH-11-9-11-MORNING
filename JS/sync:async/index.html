    <h1>Sync / Async</h1>
    <p>
      Asynchronous JavaScript is the programming method where operations are run
      independently allowing the program to continue running while waiting for
      certain tasks to complete. Synchronous JavaScript is the programming
      approach where tasks of a program are executed sequentially one at a time.
